## Project Overview
The **Smart Home Remote Access System** provides a way to remotely monitor and control smart devices within a home network. It follows a **client-server model**, where a **server** manages device states and processes commands from **clients** over a network.

This project covers:
- Designing a network protocol for device communication.
- Implementing a server that handles client requests and maintains device states.
- Developing a client application to interact with the server.
- Ensuring security and data integrity for remote access.

## System Architecture
The system is structured as follows:
- **Server**: Manages the state of smart home devices and processes client commands.
- **Client**: Sends requests to the server to control or retrieve device states.
- **Communication Protocol**: A custom application-layer protocol ensures structured messaging between clients and the server.

### Interaction Flow:
1. The client sends a request (e.g., turn on a light).
2. The server processes the request and updates the device state.
3. The server responds to the client with the result of the operation.

## Features
- Secure communication between client and server.
- Device state management via the server.
- Support for multiple smart home devices.
- Logging of interactions for debugging and monitoring.
- Scalable architecture for future extensions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed
- Required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-home-remote-access.git
   cd smart-home-remote-access
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```
4. Start the client:
   ```sh
   python client.py
   ```

## Usage
- The client interacts with the server using a predefined set of commands.
- Example client command to request device status:
  ```sh
  python client.py --status --device light1
  ```
- Example command to turn on a device:
  ```sh
  python client.py --command on --device light1
  ```

## Testing
- The system includes unit tests to validate functionality.
- Run tests using:
  ```sh
  python -m unittest discover tests/
  ```
